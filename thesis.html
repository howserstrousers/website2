				My senior thesis is a study of my taste examined through the exploration of new mediums. It is a process centric investigation of content. It takes into careful consideration the value of visual comparisons and their points of contest.
				<br>
				<br>
				The exploration in new mediums began with furthering my web design skills through implementation of JQuery and Javascript, in addition to furthering existing knowledge of css and html. Learning and implementing the features of javascript at a fairly technical level through the development of the user interface (UI) solidified my ability to apply these new skills. Applying my formal training and understanding of publication design, I developed the UI to create a dynamic spacial layout between photo collections to change the viewer’s experience while they interact. The user is able to manipulate the website, forming their own ideas via sliders, buttons, and hidden objects. In addition to exploring experimental on-screen mediums, I implemented motion design skills learned throughout the past year. Each slider has a gif that serves to highlight a topic-specific summary. I developed a vertical motion sequence to visualize my process throughout this project, focusing on content collections and thesis research texts. The vertical orientation of this video is designed to accommodate mobile platforms. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Off-screen I chose to explore my interest of silkscreen. I created a pattern from hand rendered marks. The original forms were adjusted and manipulated in photoshop and illustrator to create a repeating 15” x 22.5” screen. At this point I repeated the pattern across pieces of clear film in 2 colors that were hung back to back on the walls of a structure. This structure an 8’ x 8’ x 8’ free-standing cube with open walls. The structure was constructed from 2x4’s, airplane cable, brackets and screws. The “cube” was a further exploration in woodworking and interest in structural installation — this non archival installation style was first explored via an art show I co-curated and produced called “Tell Me Everything.”
				<br>
				<br>
				I paid close attention to the visual direction of the final deliverable. As a completely self idealized project I was able to curate my visual preferences using images to categorize them topically. I believe the final deliverable was almost  exactly what I envisioned. I consider this project a valid representation of my taste and aesthetic while the execution adheres to my defined process.
